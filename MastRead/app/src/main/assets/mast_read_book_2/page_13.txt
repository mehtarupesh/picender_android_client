Munnu's Colourful meals.

Munnu was eating her lunch. She liked potatoes. She ate potatoes and nothing else.
Try some vegetables. said her father. No. said Munnu. Try some red and orange carrots. said her mother. No. said Munnu. Look at my plate. There are so many colours on it. said her father.

But I dont want any colours. I dont like any colours. said Munnu. The colour fairy was listening. She told everyone Munnu doesnt like colours. In the evening, Munnu went to the park with her father. There was a balloonman at the gate. He had many balloons. blue and red and pink and orange and green.
