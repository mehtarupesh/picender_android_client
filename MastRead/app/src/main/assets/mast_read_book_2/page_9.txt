Six honest serving men.

I keep six honest serving men. 
They taught me all I knew. 
Their names are what and why and when 
and how and where and who.

I send them over land and sea. 
I send them east and west. 
But after they have worked for me. 
I give them all a rest.

I let them rest from nine till five.
For I am busy then.
As well as breakfast lunch and tea.
For they are hungry men.

But different folk have different views
I know a person small.
She keeps ten million serving-men.
Who get no rest at all.
