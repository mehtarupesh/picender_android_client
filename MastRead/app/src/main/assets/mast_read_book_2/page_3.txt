The stag at the pool.
One day, a beautiful came to a pool of clear water. As he bent down to drink, he saw his own reflection in the water. He was delighted with what we saw. Instead of drinking water, he kept looking at his own reflection.How handsome I look. he said to himself. How beautiful are these curving antlers. How they add to my beauty. How graceful they look.

Then he moved nearer and saw his legs reflected in the pool. He was quite disgusted. Look at my legs. Ugh. They are so ugly. All spindly with small feet. How I wish that nature had given me legs worthy of my stately antlers.
