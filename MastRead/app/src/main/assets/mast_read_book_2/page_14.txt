Oh, look at the red rose.
Look.
This pink rose is so pretty.
And this rose is white.
This one is yellow.
Let us water the roses.
Let us water the green plants.
These plants look so dry.
There are no leaves on them.
Give them some water.
After a few days,
they will get new leaves.
They will have flowers.
It is fun to work in the garden.
