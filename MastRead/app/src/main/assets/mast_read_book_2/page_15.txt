Munnu wanted to buy a colourful balloon.
Oh, but you dont like colours. said all the balloons. Munnu and her father went to a flower shop. There were many flowers in the shop. Pink and red and yellow and violet.

The flowers look so pretty. Such bright colours. said Munnu.
But you dont like colours. said the flowers.

Then Munnu remembered her favourite red dress and yellow ball and blue shoes. When she sat down to her dinner she said. I do like colours but not on my plate.
You need not have all the colours on your plate. said her mother.
Right, I dont think we have anything blue here. said her father.
Colourful meals are good meals. said her mother. you must have atleast three different colours on your plate. I will try. Munnu said. After that, Munnu's meals became quite colourful. How about yours.
