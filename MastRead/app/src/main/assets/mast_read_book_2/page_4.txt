 As he was brooding in this way, the stag heard an arrow going swish across the pool. At the same time, he picked up the scent of hunters. With a quick turn, he boudned away. His legs carried him swiftly into the forest. The hunters were hot on his trail but they were no match for his speed. Soon the stag left the hunters far behind.
 Safe and out of the hunters' reach, the stag slowed down. Suddenly, without realizing it, he walked into a thicket. There were trees with strong branches growing close together. And alas. The same antlers of which he was so proud of got caught in the thick growth.

The stag tried to shake himself free, but the more he struggled, the more entangled his antlers got in the branches.

Once again, the stag could hear the hunters drawing close, and grew afraid. At last, with great diffculty, he mananged to free his antlers and bounded away.

I realize now that my ugly feet saved my life. I was so proud of these handsome antlers, but they would have been the cause of my death. Very often, we dislike the very things that are most useful to us.
