Bubbles.
Bubbles, bubbles, everywhere
Landing on the floor.
Bubbles, bubbles, everywhere
Floating to the door.
Big ones and small ones
Shining in the sun.
Bubbles popping all around
Oh, what fun.

listen carefully and do as I say.
Take some water in a cup.
Put a small spoonful of soap powder in it.
Add a drop of oil and stir.
Take a straw.
Dip one end of straw in the soap water.
Take it out of water and blow through the other end to make bubbles.
Blow beautiful bubbles.
