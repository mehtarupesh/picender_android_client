Be a craftsman.

Many times you see fancy sheets of paper with beautiful designs or prints. Would you like to prepare you own fancy sheets of paper. Try the following idea. But remember to ask for you parents' permission and help to do it. You may also try this in your classroom with the help of your teacher.

What you need.
A plastic bucket or a tub, water, kerosene or turpentine, plain sheets of white or coloured drawing paper, oil paints. blue, red, yellow, green etc. paintbrush, clips etc.

What you do.
Fill three-fourths of the bucket or tub with water.
Add kerosene or turpentine to the paints that you have in separate tins. This will make the paints thinner. Do it with the help of an adult.
Add a few drops of paints to the water, using the paintbrush. Stir the water gently with the brush. You will see the paints (colours) twirling around in water.
