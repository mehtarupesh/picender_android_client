Prince Brahma-datta ascended the throne after his father's death. He had received his education at the famous university of Takshashila. He had mastered all branches of learning and arts. His visage was noble and conduct, righteous. He held no prejudices against anyone. When people came to him with their grievances, he listened to them patiently and gave judgements without partiality. He was loved by all his subjects.

Following his example, his ministers and other officers also administered law with justice. And yet, the young king was not happy.

The king noticed that the law suits that came to his court gradually reduced in number. In fact, there came a time when the hustle and bustle in the courts of law ceased altogether. The courts were almost deserted.
